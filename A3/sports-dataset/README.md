The Sports Dataset from kaggle can be downlaoded and placed here.

You have two ways to do this:

1. Either download from Kaggle, extract the content and paste them here

OR

2. Simple run the following cURL command which handles everything for you:

```bash
curl -L https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/gpiosenka/sports-classification | bsdtar -xf- -C ~/RTML/A3/sports-dataset/
```

Note: Replace the paths though : )
